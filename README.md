# EncryptedFileSharingProject
This project was for CS161 (Computer Security) at UC Berkeley. I built an end-to-end encrypted file sharing system for multiple users to add, edit, delete, and share files within their own userspace. All data was to be secure from other users with revoked file-sharing priveleges, as well as malicious actors who can access the datastore themselves. Detailed specifications are included below.
